Thank you for joining the movement to pay lasting tribute to those who matter to you. 

Some ideas to get you started:

Upload a few photos right away, and affix a few short captions. Some photographs truly are worth a thousand words. 

Start thinking of people who’ve made an impact on you throughout your life. Take a mental or digital note of anyone you come up with, and start reserving time in your schedule to write down their stories. 

Consider writing stories as a daily expression of gratitude for the people around you. It can be part-journal, part-thank-you-note. 

Whenever you or a friend says, “Remember when...,” consider jotting that down to write about later. You’ll never know what other memories they'll trigger. 

Wishing you well,
Team Antho
